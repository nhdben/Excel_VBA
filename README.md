This repository is intended to share my excel-vba projects

## payback_period:
The function reads cashflows from the worksheet as input, calculates the payback period and returns the final value as output, in case the project has no payback period, the   function will return ” Project does not pay back”.  
The function can be further customized where the user is forced to either enter all data as row/column.
